Summary: The analyzed sequence corresponds to cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (CDKN1A/p21), a highly conserved protein involved in regulating the cell cycle. Bioinformatics analysis confirmed its protein-coding potential and correct translation. Physicochemical property analysis supported the stability and functional relevance of the protein. Phylogenetic analysis showed strong evolutionary conservation among mammalian species. RNA secondary structure prediction indicated structural flexibility. Subcellular localization tools consistently predicted nuclear localization. Protein-protein interaction analysis identified CDKN1A as a key regulatory hub in cell cycle control and DNA damage response.
